            <p>Hi, I am Natalie Ricci, and I am a Full Stack Software Engineer. I live in the L.A. area with my husband, two kids, two cats, one dog, and 30,000 bees (Iâ€™m an amateur beekeeper). As a lifelong learner, I am excited to continue developing my skills as an engineer.

            Most recently in higher education, I was a community college English Professor and freelance writer and editor for over eight years before attending the Grace Hopper Program, which gives me a lot of experience working with people, ideas, and communication. I look forward to improving people's lives and bettering the planet through technology.
