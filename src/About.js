                  Hi, I am Natalie Ricci, and I am a Full Stack Software
                  Engineer. I live in the L.A. area with my husband, two kids,
                  two cats, one dog, and 30,000 bees (Iâ€™m an amateur beekeeper).
                  As a lifelong learner, I am excited to continue developing my
                  skills as an engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most recently in higher education, I was a community college
                  English Professor and freelance writer and editor for over
                  eight years before attending the Grace Hopper Program, which
                  gives me a lot of experience working with people, ideas, and
                  communication. I look forward to improving people's lives and
                  bettering the planet through technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I'm not coding, you can find me reading at the beach,
                  hiking in the woods, baking bread in my flour-dusted kitchen,
                  and creating in all kinds of ways.
