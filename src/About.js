                  Hi, I am Natalie Ricci, and I am a Full Stack Software
                  Engineer. I live in the L.A. area with my husband, two kids,
                  two cats, one dog, and 30,000 bees (Iâ€™m an amateur beekeeper).
                  As a lifelong learner, I am excited to continue developing my
                  skills as an engineer.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Most recently in higher education, I was a community college
                  English Professor and freelance writer and editor for over ten
                  years before becoming a developer, which gives me a rich
                  background working with people, ideas, and communication. I
                  look forward to using these skills to improving people's lives
                  and better the planet through technology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When I'm not coding, you can find me reading at the beach,
                  hiking in the woods, baking, creating, and scheming of ways to
                  travel the globe.
                </p>
